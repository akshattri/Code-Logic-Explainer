# Code-Logic-Explainer

## Description

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to automatically generate natural language explanations for code logic, leveraging a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence architecture. The aim is to bridge the gap between source code and human-readable explanations, aiding in code understanding and documentation.

## Features

- GRU-based sequence-to-sequence model
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Training and evaluation on explanation generation
- Model checkpointing and loading

## Future Work

- Incorporate transformer-based models like BART or T5.
- Expand to multi-language code datasets.
- Add web-based interface for live demo.
